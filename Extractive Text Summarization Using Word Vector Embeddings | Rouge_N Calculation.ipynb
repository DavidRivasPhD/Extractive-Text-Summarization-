    "Text summarization, as the name implies, is a technique to summarize large pieces of text. Our goal is to generate summaries that make sense - remember high school and summarizing papers and books? Yes, we have to get the machine to do that.  This far from an easy task; it is actually an area of active research.  However, there are some tools in our arsenal we can use to make this task less daunting.  \n",

    "What Is Snail Mucin?\n",
    "Simply put, it’s the excretion from a snail, which is why it’s also known and appears on ingredient labels as snail secretion filtrate, or SSF. Snail mucin is naturally created and used by snails as way for them to protect themselves, says Desai-Solomon. It’s a trusted ingredient in the K-beauty world and has become a popular one because it can offer noticeable results, she adds. Worth noting: This isn’t an excretion that comes out whenever the snail moves, but rather a substance that's excreted when the snail is under stress, points out Lain (more on the importance of that in a minute).\n",
    "Snail mucin is a mega multi-tasker, with the ability to do everything from moisturize to boost the production of collagen, the protein responsible for strong, youthful skin.\n",
    "Moisturizes the skin: According to Lain, snail mucin contains moisturizing agents that work to repair the barrier function of the skin, both locking out irritants from the environment while also simultaneously locking in moisture.\n",
    "Stimulates collagen production: Because snail mucin is a stress-induced excretion, it's comprised of ingredients meant to repair or protect from injury,\" Lain explains. These include growth factors, which work by triggering the growth of new skin cells and new collagen. And, as we know, more collagen equals fewer wrinkles and younger-looking skin. Desai-Solomon adds that it also contains glycolic acid, another known collagen-booster.\n",
    "Soothes irritation: Allantoin is another key component in the secretion, an ingredient with healing properties that calms irritation, as well as smooths the skin and stimulates cell regeneration.\n",
    "Delivers important vitamins and minerals:  Snail mucin is loaded with a list of good-for-your skin nutrients, including anti-inflammatory zinc and healing manganese. It contains copper peptides, also lauded for their collagen-increasing and wrinkle-decreasing effect, as well as vitamins A and E, both of which are great antioxidants.\n",
    "There aren’t any well-documented side effects of snail mucin, says Desai-Solomon, though both dermatologists point out that, as with any ingredient, people can be allergic to it. Avoid allergic reactions by testing a small amount of any new product on the inside of your forearm before slathering it all over your face. And if you're using any type of prescription-strength treatments, Desai-Solomon recommends speaking with your derm before adding any new product into your line-up.\n",
    "This largely depends on your particular complexion concerns and what you hope to get from the ingredient. According to Desai-Solomon, many people like using snail mucin for moisturizing purposes, in which case she suggests opting for a night cream that contains it. (Bedtime is a prime opportunity for your skin to reap not only the hydration benefits, but also the other restorative and regenerative properties of the ingredient as well.) Apply it every evening on clean skin, as the final step in your routine, layered over any other treatment products, such as toners or serums.\n",
    "If you're looking to use snail mucin as a multi-purpose anti-ager, seek it out in a serum, as these will have a higher concentration of the ingredient. Apply it morning and night, right after cleansing and before any other product.\n",

    "text = '''This introduction aims to tell the story of how we put words into computers. It is part of the story of the field of natural language processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence. It targets a wide audience with a basic understanding of computer programming, but avoids a detailed mathematical treatment, and it does not present any algorithms. It also does not focus on any particular application of NLP such as translation, question answering, or information extraction. The ideas presented here were developed by many researchers over many decades, so the citations are not exhaustive but rather direct the reader to a handful of papers that are, in the author's view, seminal. After reading this document, you should have a general understanding of word vectors (also known as word embeddings): why they exist, what problems they solve, where they come from, how they have changed over time, and what some of the open questions about them are. Readers already familiar with word vectors are advised to skip to Section 5 for the discussion of the most recent advance, contextual word vectors'''"

    "Pretty cool, right? It's that simple. \n",
    "To really understand how this works, we are going to implement this ourselves.  \n",
    "Let's first talk about how TextRanks works. In the simplest terms, we will give each sentence in our text sample a score and we will then sort them in away that it matches the position they're in the text sample.\n",
    "Imagine we have a set number of sentences, let's call this N. Let's also assume there's some sort of relationship between these sentences, a score of sorts. In order, to rank the sentences in order of importance, we need to compute said scores.  To do this, let's make our sentences vectors and create a matrix. Each element of this matrix denotes the similarity between two vector-sentences. A good way to compute similarity is to use the cosine distance. The cosine similarity computes the cosine of the angle between 2 vectors. If the vectors are identical, the cosine is 1.0 and if he vectors are orthogonal, the cosine is 0.0 and we will initialize our probabilities as such. \n",
    "\n",
